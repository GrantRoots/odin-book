# odin-book

This is an app I made using express, prisma with pgsql, and react. This is a social media site like instagram where users can upload, like, and comment on posts. Follow eachother and have a feed of their and their followings posts. They can also create a profile with a bio and custom profile picture. For every user there is a list of all the users so you can send them a follow request that they can choose to accept or decline.
